This repository contains all the nodes, models for gazebo environment, launch files, simulations and all the archictechture verify the theory and hypothesis related to the research "Transformation of Physical Environments through Integrated Sensor Fusion and Computer Vision for Interactive Digital Recreation" thus developing a in order to development a minimun viable product.

As you can see, we have three folders: **_Gazebo_models_**, **_environment_tiago_** and **_ros2_ws_**. The first one contains all the mesh models used in the gazebo environment (necessary to insert them in our simulation), the second one, contains the simulation worlds along with the TIAGo models to use them in the simulation (These elements were obtained from Francisco Rico's book). Finally,**_ros2_ws_** contains all the nodes and launch files created for the 3D reconstruction. Each folder will be explained to create this environment in your own device.
